    <h1><b>MY SELF</b></h1>
    <div id="A">
I am in the person of Princess Michelle Osekre.
    I'm 14 years of age. I am a student, who schools in Aburi Girls' with a passion for learning, praying, reading, dancing, exploring and doing other cool things. I have 4 siblings and I am a smart and intelligent girl.
     I'm a curious and driven individual who loves exploring new ideas, meeting new people, and learning from diverse experiences. 
     With a strong foundation in [your skills/education], I'm excited to grow both personally and professionally. 
     I have big plans for the future and I would love to visit other countries apart from Ghana, I do want to visit India.
     I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and making meaningful relationships.
        I am a friendly person with of course strict parents but i have wild siblings who love to make noise and are destined to annoy me.
        Apart from my siblings being annoying, my life is fun. I like learning about the modern things of life and as part of this modern era
        computers have developed the World into a very fun and easy way. I like computers that why my Dad wanted me to join this wonderful class of coding.
        My life is good because God is in it.
